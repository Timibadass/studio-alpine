- Nuxt Studio is a git-based CMS tool powered by Nuxt Content used for building Nuxt 3 applications. It is built on top of GitHub and it provides a seamless two-way sync between your repository and Studio, granting content teams complete autonomy within the developer-approved stack. This means that with Nuxt Studio, users do not need to bother with setting up a separate database to manage/store content. It also makes it easy to keep track of present and past changes made to your files and projects.
